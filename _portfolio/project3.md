I hope that one day robot can replace human to work in dangerous places. In this work, I make the humanoid robot to carry a fire-hose during walking. Keeping balance of a robot with 34-DOF is difficult, not to mention carrying a soft fire-hose. I predict the desired pulling force and try to compensate the disturbance force from the robot hand which holds the hose.
