A walking pattern generator is designed based on MPC with basis functions. Basis functions like Laguerre and Haar functions are introduced to represent the input of MPC and they reduced the computation load. We tested the proposed method by experiment using humanoid robot HRP-2. This work is published in [Advanced Robotics](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01691864.2019.1594366).
