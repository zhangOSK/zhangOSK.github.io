Pivoting manipulation is suitable for moving large and heavy objects because the most weight of the object is supported by the floor. We propose graph MPC to realize a pivoting gait. Two gait modes are designed which are Douple Support(DS) mode and Quadruple Support(QS) mode. The DS mode is fast while the QS mode is stable. A graph is proposed to select a proper sequence of gait mode. Then, MPC is used to track a desired trajecotry.
